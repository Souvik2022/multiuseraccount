# multiuseraccount

hello the user part is done

the user part code is divided into different sections the controllers ,  the routes  and also the usermodel 

i have connected it to mongo db compass the json files are properly getting stored 

and also multer and bcrypt packages were also used to crypt and store the user data + images 

unfortunately the node modules part is so large it cant be uploaded in github so i have uploaded the screenshot 

the email and password part is kept blank and mentioned in the code and also in order to run it 

just install the local mongo db file and start a server and replace the existing code however you have to configure 

the node moodule file 

all the codes for this much part is properly alligned in thier respective files and also the routing portion and post and get 

request files are also provided 

the admin part cant be completed because that is connected  to the main user list frame and it would require thrrough testing 

before applying so for the this much i have done
